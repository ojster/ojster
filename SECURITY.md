# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security and bug fixes are generally provided only for the most recent minor release. Fixes may be shipped as part of the next minor version or, when necessary, as an on‑demand patch release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We strongly encourage responsible disclosure. If you discover a potential security issue, we appreciate your report.

Please use the **“Report a vulnerability”** button under the **Security** tab of the GitHub repository. This opens a private communication channel between you and the maintainers so the issue can be investigated and resolved safely.
